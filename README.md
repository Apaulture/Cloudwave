# Cloudwave VR
Cloudwave is an atmospheric VR rhythm game built for the Oculus Quest which initially begun as a semester project for Video Game Development Association at California State University, Long Beach.

The game consists of two parts. The first half of the experience involves a rhythm game where the player's objective is to touch or catch (with hands and body) procedurally generated musical notes. The second half takes the player through a truly awesome elevator experience where the player sees the entire city fall beneath him/her. The surrounding city is also proceudrally generated so each playthrough will be its own unique experience.

**Cloudwave is an ongoing project and we are currently looking for:**
- Audio Engineer
- 3D Artist

Feel like contributing to the future of music experiences?
